# Gameathon

Gameathon is a 24-hour event organized by the Department of Information Science and Engineering of Jyothy Institute of Technology, Bangalore. It is a platform for aspiring developers to bring together their ideas into a game that they can call their own. This event also offers attractive prizes to the developers that create a working game that fits the given theme.
It was first started in 2018 when a few students who were into gaming of that time wanted to create a game for others to play. They learnt Unity, the free gaming platform and created a game. It was fun. This inspired them to create an event just for game creation and led to the birth of Gameathon.
The first two Gameathon were held Offline at intra collegiate level. However, Gameathon 3.0 was held online due to the pandemic, this time including other colleges from Bangalore. All of them were huge successes. This is why we brought back Gameathon 4.0 as a National level event.
